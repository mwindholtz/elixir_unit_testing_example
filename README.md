# elixir_unit_testing_example
Example code for live_view_counter and how to structure and unit test it.

Starts with the live_view_counter example by Dennis Beatty (but with ecto)

And adds structure and unit tests.

Normally, you would never add this much design structure to a simple program.
But with more complicated programs, seeing the structure gets difficult because they are complicated. 

So this is an attempt to add _unneeded structure_  in violation of YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)
YAGNI is an important guide when growing real programs using TDD.

Here I'm attempting to show some patterns that may end up in the later stages of growing that code.
